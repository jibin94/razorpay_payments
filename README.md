## Plugin Used
- [razorpay_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/razorpay_flutter)

## Prerequisites
- Learn about the [Razorpay Payment Flow](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/payment-gateway/how-it-works/).
- Sign up for a [Razorpay Account](https://accounts.razorpay.com/auth/?redirecturl=https%3A%2F%2Fdashboard.razorpay.com&auth_intent=login) and generate the [API Keys](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/api-keys/#api-keys/) from the Razorpay Dashboard. Using the Test keys helps simulate a sandbox environment. No actual monetary transaction happens when using the Test keys. Use Live keys once you have thoroughly tested the application and are ready to go live.
- Use [test cards](https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/payments/test-card-details/) to test Indian, international and EMI payments, and Subscriptions.
